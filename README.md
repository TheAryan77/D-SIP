🚀 D-SIP: Decentralized Systematic Investment Platform

A fully on-chain SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) engine that allows users to automate recurring crypto investments, build diversified portfolios, stake assets for yield, and rebalance portfolios — all powered by smart contracts, Chainlink/Gelato automation, and The Graph indexing.

D-SIP brings the simplicity of mutual fund SIPs into Web3 with complete transparency, decentralization, and programmable investment strategies.

🔥 Core Features
✅ Automated SIP Execution (Chainlink/Gelato)

Invest daily, weekly, or monthly into any crypto asset or portfolio.
Execution handled trustlessly by decentralized automation.

✅ Multi-Asset & Portfolio SIPs

Split your SIP amount across multiple assets (ETH, BTC, MATIC, LINK, etc.) or custom portfolios.

✅ Auto-Yield SIP

Automatically stake or lend purchased tokens via Aave, Lido, Curve, or custom strategies.

✅ Auto-Rebalancing

Keep your portfolio allocation stable with periodic or deviation-based rebalancing.

✅ Cross-Chain SIP (Optional)

Invest across multiple chains using LayerZero/Wormhole routing.

✅ Indexing via The Graph

Real-time dashboards with historical SIP logs, execution history, portfolio value & analytics.

✅ Non-Custodial Vaults

Users retain full control of their funds. Vaults are permissionless and transparent.
